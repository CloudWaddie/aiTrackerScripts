<b>Important:</b> To setup internal knowledge you must give ChatGPT access to the full list of Google permissions on the next step. If you do not keep all the boxes checked you will not be able to proceed.
<b>Note</b>: Only users with the <i>same</i> Google Workspace domain can connect. Your email should look like <code>example.com</code> — personal accounts won’t work. Be sure you’re using the right one.

A clean and minimalistic logo featuring an ice cream cone in soft pastel colors. The cone should be simple and stylized, with a swirl of ice cream on top in shades of pink, mint green, and creamy yellow. The background should be flat and light in tone to keep the focus on the logo. Designed in a modern, professional, and friendly style, suitable for a boutique ice cream brand.
A dreamy sky scene featuring the phrase 
A flat-style digital illustration of two diverse professionals collaborating at a desk with a laptop in a modern office setting. One person points at the screen while the other considers thoughtfully, and a shared thought bubble above them contains a glowing lightbulb, symbolizing a joint idea. Use a soft, modern color palette with clean lines and a minimal, professional aesthetic suitable for a startup or business environment. 1x1 aspect ratio.
A folder owner or editor can change these instructions to have ChatGPT focus on certain topics, or respond in a certain tone or format.
A high-quality 3D-rendered illustration of a color wheel logo. The design features eight symmetrical, petal-shaped leaves arranged in a perfect circular flower pattern. Each leaf is semi-transparent like colored glass, rendered in soft pastel tones including pink, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. The petals overlap slightly, creating gentle blended hues where they intersect. The background is a flat, light-toned surface with even, diffused lighting, giving the image a modern, polished, and professional appearance. No text.
A more personalized assistant
A new version of ChatGPT Windows is available and must be installed to continue.
A project owner or editor can change these instructions to have ChatGPT focus on certain topics, or respond in a certain tone or format.
A risograph-inspired 2D digital illustration of a diverse group of coworkers collaborating in a modern office. Use a limited color palette (like red, blue, yellow, and green) with visible halftone textures and grainy overlays. The style should evoke a retro print aesthetic while maintaining a bright, energetic, and professional tone.
